Here are the steps that need to be followed for Scenario 1 and 2 
-If you want the robot to do scenario 1 set MAX_NUMBER_HOUSES to 1 
-If you want the robot to do scenario 2 set MAX_NUMBER_HOUSES to 2 or more
-Upload the code
-Turn On the robot
-Place the robot anywhere in the maze
-Press the button A

For Scenario 3 here are the steps:
-Upload the code
-Turn On the robot
-Place the robot at the start of the maze
-Press the button A
The robot will navigate through the maze so that it can map the maze and store the shortest path then it will be able to use that shortets path to make a delivry for that we are using a BFS algorithm

Here are some useful resources that I used
